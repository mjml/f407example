### TODO ###
============

* USE_HAL_PCD_REGISTER_CALLBACKS defined or not?

* Examine the USB Core / CDC Layer, the Glue Layer (HAL_PCD_yyyy callbacks and HAL_LL_xxxx functions), and the low-level HAL_PCD and layers

* Find out how to adjust the heap size upward since USB/CDC seems to use a bit more than is normally provided. The f407zet should have plenty.
